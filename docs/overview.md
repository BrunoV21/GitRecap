# Overview of git_recap

## What is git_recap?

git_recap is a GitHub app designed to provide users with concise and insightful summaries of their Git repository activity. It automatically generates recaps of commits, pull requests, issues, and other relevant events, offering a quick way to understand the development history and current state of a project.

## Purpose

The main purpose of git_recap is to simplify the process of understanding and tracking changes within a Git repository. Instead of manually reviewing logs and activity streams, users can rely on git_recap to present them with easy-to-digest recaps, saving time and effort.

## Main Features

-   **Automated Recaps:** Generates summaries of repository activity automatically.
-   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes commits, pull requests, issues, and other relevant events.
-   **Customizable Timeframes:** Allows users to specify timeframes for recaps (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
-   **Multiple Git Provider Support:** Integrates with different Git hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Azure).
-   **User-Friendly Interface:** Presents recaps in a clean, organized, and easy-to-understand format.
- **LLM Powered**: Uses a large language model to provide a very concise summary.
- **Easy to use**: The interface is designed for ease of use.

## Target Audience

git_recap is ideal for:

-   **Developers:** Quickly catching up on project activity.
-   **Team Leads:** Monitoring team progress and identifying trends.
-   **Project Managers:** Gaining insights into project health and status.
-   **Anyone using Git:** Anyone who wants a better overview of their repository's activity without spending hours reviewing logs.

## How it Works

git_recap is installed as a GitHub app and configured to connect to one or more Git repositories. It then fetches relevant data from the chosen Git provider, processes it, and uses a large language model to create a summary. The summary is displayed in the app's frontend, allowing users to view and interact with it.
