# Backend Considerations

This document outlines the backend considerations for the `git_recap` app, including authentication, security, and credential management.

## Authentication

The `git_recap` app supports multiple authentication methods to interact with various Git providers.

### GitHub App Authentication

-   **Mechanism:** `git_recap` can be installed as a GitHub App, which provides fine-grained access to repositories.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Token):** When installed as a GitHub App, `git_recap` uses JWTs for secure authentication. The app generates a JWT signed with the app's private key, which is then used to authenticate API requests.
-   **OAuth:** Alternatively, OAuth 2.0 can be used for user-specific actions.
-   **Benefits:** Provides secure, scoped access to repositories and webhooks.

### API Tokens (GitLab)

-   **Mechanism:** GitLab provides API tokens that can be used to authenticate API requests.
-   **Usage:** Users can generate API tokens with specific scopes (e.g., `read_repository`) within their GitLab accounts and provide them to the `git_recap` app.
-   **Considerations:** API tokens should be stored securely and have limited scopes to minimize potential damage if compromised.

### Personal Access Tokens (PATs) (Azure DevOps)

-   **Mechanism:** Azure DevOps uses Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for authentication.
-   **Usage:** Users can generate PATs with defined scopes (e.g., `code_read`) in their Azure DevOps profiles. These tokens are then provided to the `git_recap` app.
-   **Considerations:** Similar to GitLab API tokens, PATs should be stored securely and have the minimum necessary permissions.

## Security Measures

Security is a top priority for `git_recap`. We implement several measures to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.

### Input Validation

-   **Purpose:** All input from the frontend and external sources is carefully validated to prevent injection attacks and other common vulnerabilities.
-   **Implementation:** We use strict input validation rules to ensure that data conforms to expected types, formats, and lengths.

### Rate Limiting

-   **Purpose:** To prevent abuse and stay within the API rate limits of the Git providers.
-   **Implementation:** We implement rate limiting on API requests to both internal and external services. This helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures the app remains within the allowed API usage.
